##How It Works
This project shows a qrcode in which the user inputs a website link and a qrcode will be made based on what they inserted leading to them being directed to the website. 
##Logic
I used Python imports and an input statement that set parameters for the design of my QRCode. This helped me learn more about the use of parameters and how they can be critical while making projects like this.
